# Decentralised Payment Gateway Application using Blockchain
Despite technological advancements, centralized payment gateway systems face significant challenges. High transaction fees imposed by intermediaries burden merchants and consumers, reducing profitability for businesses. Reliance on centralized entities introduces vulnerabilities like single points of failure, security breaches, and potential censorship, limiting innovation and risking user privacy and financial sovereignty. Traditional systems lack interoperability and scalability, hindering value exchange across platforms. Centralized systems' lack of transparency and accountability undermines trust, particularly in disputed transactions or fraud cases. Regulatory barriers and geographical restrictions worsen financial exclusion. There's a need for decentralized payment solutions using emerging tech to enhance efficiency, security, and inclusivity.
